Technologies investigated:

* Mosquitto
* RabbitMQ
* nats jetstream + mqtt enabled
* HiveMQ
* EMQX
* VerneMQ

Mosquitto, HiveMQ and EMQX was disregarded due to lack of needed features or such features beeing behind a paywall.



==== RabbitMQ

* TLS support: Yes
* Message persistence support: Yes
* Authentication: Yes
* Clustering support: Yes
* MQTT protocol support: v3.1.1 (as a plugin). RabbitMQ 3.13, the next release series, is expected to be released end of 2023 and will support MQTT protocol version 5.0.
* Free/Open source: Yes

* Pros:
** Wide adoption
** Supported by VMware
** Supports all needed features
** Also has support for other message protocols
* Cons:
** Does not support mqtt v5 as of latest release

==== VerneMQ

* TLS support: Yes
* Message persistence support: No
* Authentication: Yes
* Clustering support: Yes
* MQTT protocol support: v3.1.1  and v5
* Free/Open source: Yes

* Pros:
** Supports all needed features
** Only supports mqtt, less complex
* Cons:
** No possiblity for message persistence, but this is ok according to the design decisions in E-SOH. The API endpoints will provide possibility to retrieve data 24 hours back in time.

==== Need resolving before descion

* Do we need assurance of mqtt v5 before deciding? RabbitMQ seems to be launching v5 before the end of the year.
* Is MET Norway going to use the broker, and does MET Norway need persistence?
* Clients must have a way to retrieve old messages if a solution without persistence is selected, but the EDR API should be able to handle this.

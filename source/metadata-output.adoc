By using the link:https://github.com/metno/py-mmd-tools[py-mmd-tools package] developed at MET Norway,
one can create a link:https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/metno/mmd/blob/master/doc/mmd-specification.html[MET Norway Metadata Format] (MMD) file from a properly documented dataset (here NetCDF4).

By using the xslt-transformations defined in the link:https://github.com/metno/mmd/tree/master/xslt[MMD-repo], one can then transform to different metadata standards.

See link:https://github.com/EURODEO/e-soh-poc-report/blob/main/poc-experiments/metadata-outputs[/metadata-output folder] for simple python script to go through all the xslt-translations from the xslt-folder (you need to have lxml installed, and xslt-folder copied where you want to run the script).

Deciding on one internal metadata format will then facilitate increased interoperability when translations between the different metadata-formats are in place.

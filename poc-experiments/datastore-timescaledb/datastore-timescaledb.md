## TimescaleDB research/experiments
TimescaleDB is an open-source database designed to make SQL scalable for time-series data.  
It extends PostgreSQL with features such as native time-series partitioning, compression, and continuous aggregates to improve the performance and scalability of time-series data management.

Hypertables are PostgreSQL tables with special features that improve performance and user experience for time-series data. Hypertables are divided in chunks that hold data only from a specific time range. When a query for a particular time range is executed, the planner can ignore chunks that have data outside of that time range.

TimescaleDBâ€™s native compression works by converting uncompressed rows of data into compressed columns. When new data is added to database, it is in the form of uncompressed rows. TimescaleDB uses a built-in job scheduler to convert this data to the form of compressed columns.
Compression can be enabled on individual hypertables by declaring which columns to segment by. Once compression is enabled, the data can then be compressed in by using an automatic policy or manually compressing chunks.
By reducing the amount of data that needs to be read, compression can lead to increases in performance. However, benefits of compression depends on data and queries that are run against it.

One useful TimescleDB feature is continuous aggregates which can be used to pre-aggregate data into useful summaries. Materialized views are used to continuously and incrementally refresh a query in the background.

TimescaleDB has built-in support for horizontal scaling through its multi-node feature. One of the databases exists on an access node and stores metadata about the other databases. The other databases are located on data nodes and hold the actual data. Multi-node setup improves write scalability and query performance, but it can be more complex to setup and manage.

TimescaleDB also support master-replica setup as it is built on top of PostgreSQL. This setup brings high availability and read scalability but write scalability might be a bottleneck.

How to test:

- Add Timescale extension to current PostGIS database
- Add new TimescaleDB backend to https://github.com/EURODEO/e-soh-datastore-poc/tree/main/tstester (main thing is to convert regular tables to hypertables) 
- Experiment with different setups (changing chunk_time_interval, maybe test how compression affects ingestion performance and so on).
